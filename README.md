Goaltending edge: Darcy Kuemper has been a Vezina-caliber player in net for LA, saving 24 more goals than he is expected to give up this season.
Matchup of Game Tactics: Defense and Offense
This series is a classic battle of styles:
Los Angeles Kings: Top-notch defensive structure (yes yes yes), three excellent defensive centers, and a line of Mikey Anderson, Vladislav Gavrikov, and Drew Doughty that can shut down anyone. Their home-ice scoring margin (100-48) is the best in the world, but the offense drops off away from home.
Edmonton Oilers: Fast-paced attack run by Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl with Evan Bouchard and a speedy defense. The Oilers’ power play is still deadly, but their finishing at even strength has slipped and they will be without Mattias Ekholm’s defensive presence until at least the first round.
X-Factors & Key Players
Kings
Quinton Byfield: Byfield broke out on the wing in his first full season, now he gets top-six center wealth with top tic tac toe responsibility. His capacity to drive play and check Edmonton’s stars is vital.
Kevin Fiala & Adrian Kempe: Bring the offense; Fiala scored his 30th goal and Kempe had his 31st assist in the Kings’ 3-0 victory in the teams’ last matchup.
Darcy Kuemper: Goaltending can be the difference. Count Kuemper’s late-season form as a distinct advantage for LA in the et.
Oilers
Connor World M']David & Leon Draisaitl: It's just the league's hottest duo. McDavid has 36 points in 18 playoff games against LA; Draisaitl has 17 goals and 30 points in those games.
Evan Bouchard: Top offensive defenseman in the NHL, invaluable with Ekholm out.
Secondary forwards: The others will have to chime in more so than in years past, so Omar Khaira, Corey Perry, Connor Brown, and Adam Henrique will be key.
Special Teams Battle
Oilers’ power play: Still one of the top power plays in the NHL after recent rankings, primary weapon if Kings put them on the man advantage.
Mugging the Kings: LA's power play sits below the league average and the Kings' penalty kill is going to be put to the test, so discipline is imperative.

Lineup & Injury Watch
Oilers: Mattias Ekholm (top defenseman) likely misses at least the first round, so Darnell Nurse and Bouchard will be challenged to play heavy minutes. The physicality and two-way game of Evander Kane and Trent Frederic should help — both are expected back.
Kings: None; Their trio of defense and depth down the middle all healthy, plenty to combat McDavid, Draisaitl.

Match Preview, and Betting Tips
This year, the Kings vs Oilers prediction couldn't be closer:
Kings have the statistical edge, particularly at home, based on depth and defense.
The Oilers’ star power (McDavid, Draisaitl) can still win any game, but they can’t finish and are without a lot of defensemen.
Betting tip: Close, low-scoring games are expected (under 6 goals is a strong trend). If LA can shut down Edmonton's power play, they may finally have a breakthrough. But as always, betting against McDavid and Draisaitl in a Game 7 is a dangerous wager.
Conclusion
With both teams having posed true playoff contention hopes, it is surprising to see the LA Kings vs the Edmonton Oilers in 2025. If the Kings are going to knock off Edmonton, this is it — thanks to improved depth, home-ice advantage and scorching goaltending. But with McDavid and Draisaitl having extensive playoff pedigrees, the Oilers are still a dangerous threat. This series will feature drama, tension, and some of the best postseason hockey you will find, making it a great matchup for fans and bettors looking for NHL playoff betting tips and Kings vs. Oilers predictions.
